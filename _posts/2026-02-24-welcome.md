---

After years of building, shipping, and occasionally breaking things in production, I'm finally giving my writing a proper home.

## Why Move Here?

I've been writing on [Pure AI](https://pureai.substack.com) over on Substack, but I wanted full control — my own domain, my own design, and content that lives alongside my work rather than on someone else's platform. So here we are: the blog now lives at [evanm.me/blog](/blog).

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **AI and developer tools** — what we're building at Microsoft and where the industry is heading
- **Engineering craft** — architecture decisions, debugging war stories, and the patterns that actually hold up
- **Life in Seoul** — expat life in South Korea
- **Travel** — places I've been, places I'm going

## Let's Go

If any of that sounds interesting, stay tuned. The best way to follow along is to check back here or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/evanrmattson).
